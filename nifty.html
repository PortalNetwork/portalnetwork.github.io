          <p>On July 24th — 26th, Portal Network will be joining the NIFTY event in Hong Kong to reveal the latest updates on our company products and host a workshop where attendees can play a card game that Portal Network has created on blockchain, completely decentralized.</p>
          <div class="article_blockquote">
            <p>We highly appreciate this opportunity NIFTY provides as we believe that this is a great opportunity to foster the blockchain industry.</p>

          <h4>What is NIFTY about?</h4>

          <p>The Nifty event is co-hosted by Kenetic Capital and Decentraland. The event itself has two parts: conference and hackathon.</p>

          <p>In the spirit of conference like the Global Game Jam and ETHGlobal, Nifty’s goal is to gather the best developers in the space and to build a community of collaboration between different projects, such as non fungible tokens (NFTs), blockchain gaming and collectibles.</p>

          <p>One the other hand, the hackathon will bring together developers to Cyberport, which provides a comfortable space with food and beverages available for all hackers. Some workshops focused on building blockchain-based games will be held on the afternoon of the 25th. If you are interested in the card game that Portal Network has developed, you can always stop by at our workshop!</p>

          <h4>What is NFT (non fungible token)?</h4>

          <p>Different from ERC-20, each ERC-721 has its unique ownership that is traceable, which is why it is largely applied in blockchain gaming. Once the owner acquires the ERC-721 token (could be a treasure or an item in the game), nobody will be able to steal it from its owner.</p>

          <p>Most of the online games nowadays has one characteristic You can easily buy treasures or items in the game with fiat currency, but it is always hard to change the same treasures into fiat currencies. Why? Because online games are controlled by the gaming company, a centralized entity, and the company has full control of creating and deleting anything within the game, making it extremely difficult to have value in the real world.</p>

          <p>However, once applied into blockchain and ERC-721, these virtual treasures could completely owned by an individual. There will be no central control point, and no one will be able to change or delete anything. This is an evolution change in how players and developers will interact with digital goods, which eventually created unimaginable values. Kitty in CryptoKitties, for instance, was once sold for value equivalent to 250,000 USD.</p>

          <p>Portal Network will be sharing the “Big and Small” card game we designed for the workshop. This game will be utilizing ERC-721, a non-fungible token (NFT).</p>

          <p>Players can create their own wallet using the ENS (Ethereum Name Service) Portal Network provides and each wallet will be able to hold different cards that are registered as ERC-721 token. Every card will have a number on it which can be played on the platform we built. For more details, visit Portal Network at NIFTY!</p>
