          <p>On July 14th and 15th, Portal Network organized its first hackathon oversea in South Korea, inviting more than 50 participants, including its partners Wanchain, Bluzelle, Noia Network, Merkle Tree Ventures, Pledgecamp and CoinGecko. The event was co-organized by teamw.e and SOPT, and the venue was provided by D.Camp, a Korean non-profit foundation focused on young entrepreneurs.</p>

          </figure>

          <p class="text_italic">The hackathon kicked off on Saturday morning, and the participants gathered one after another, eager to learn more about the decentralized technologies we provide.</p>

          <p>“Hackathon” is a combination of “Hack” and “Marathon”. The idea behind it is to gather people from different areas to solve some of the existing problems by sharing and executing ideas in limited time. Portal Network believes that hackathon is a great way to connect people and create new ideas. We believe that scalability and user adoption are two main challenges in the current blockchain industry.</p>

          <p><strong>The topic of this hackathon is to build a decentralized project using the decentralized technologies that we provide, which include the following:</strong></p>

          <div class="article_box">
            <p>1. Portal Network, which includes IPFS and WNS in one package.</p>

            <p>2. Bluzelle, decentralized data storage.</p>

            <p>3. Noia Network, decentralized CDN.</p>

          <h4>3rd place — Teckle</h4>

          <figure class="figure img_full">

          </figure>

          <p><strong>Teckle</strong> is a study group that focuses on developing Dapps. Consider that this is comparably a new area, Teckle summarizes different tools and environment that developers will need when they first encounter this subject.</p>

          <p>As research shows that most people who set up goals such as losing weight, reading 1 book every week often find themselves giving up half way through, Teckle decided to utilize the token economy that blockchain provides to solve this problem: by giving out incentives to individuals who successfully complete the tasks.</p>

          <p>They created a platform where people can join different tasks and receive prizes after completion. To join each task, participants must make a transaction into the prize pool. They will need to provide a proof depending on the task requirements and the crowds will do the validation. When the task is completed, the prize will be divided equally to those winning participants. The entire platform’s objective is to encourage people to comply with their commitment.</p>

          <p>The data, files and content are stored completely decentralized, which made everything transparent and solved the trust issue.</p>

          <h4>2nd place — Coding Dora</h4>

          <figure class="figure img_full">
            <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*LDA1ZQaAxuJhYPgjj2Aawg.png" alt="">
          </figure>

          <p><strong>Coding Dora</strong> saw the need of transparency in donation industry, and created a platform that allows donators to tract all their donations using blockchain. What is special about this Coding Dora’s donation platform is that once the user donate to certain people, foundations or projects on the platform, they will receive an erc-20 token called “G Power,” which allows users to donate to different organizations on the platform. Organizations that receive G Power token will be able to exchange the token into ethereum with Coding Dora.</p>

          <p>By utilizing the token economy in blockchain, the platform provided an opportunity for extra donations which eventually increased the benefit that organizations and recipients could receive. It is not only transparent but definitely one step forward from the current donation industry.</p>

          <h4>Winner — Kilos Network</h4>

          <figure class="figure img_full">
            <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*rXhIrwuPUhvNSMvynD-R9w.png" alt="">
          </figure>

          <p><strong>Kilos Network</strong> is a network that has people with 1,000 ideas. They communicate, respect and fill in other people’s weaknesses. One person is not strong alone, but together, one’s strength could be infinite.</p>

          <p>Kilos Network created a taste matching platform where users can compare their tastes, interests with other people. Users can use the taste table to find someone with similar or completely different tastes and interests, so that before meeting new friends, they know what to expect from each other.</p>

          <p>Moreover, users can customize and create their own taste table, buy taste table from public figures, and sell personal taste tables to developers for management and improvements. All of the data will be utilizing the Bluzelle database, so unless shared information, no one will have access to the interests or taste of an individual, making it completely yours and secure.</p>

For the organizer and technology providers such as Wanchain, Bluzelle, Noia Network, it was a great chance to test the technology limit, which could be further improve for the better future.</p>
